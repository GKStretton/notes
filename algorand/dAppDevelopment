I learnt solidity before Reach, that helped.

Then read this: https://docs.reach.sh/guide/solidity/

Then read this: https://docs.reach.sh/tut/overview/#p_4

1. You need to install docker and blah blah.. Read the readme on basic tutorial.
2. wget the reach executable. I'm not sure why they get it into the current dir, I guess you could put it in path somewhere. I put it in ../reach.
3. ../reach -h; ../reach init (for a new dir)
4.
